President Nixon's popularity, mixed with an uncompromising left flank taking the Democrats by storm, has created the perfect storm for President Nixon to win a total landslide in November. <p> Robert is the only obstacle standing against him. His decision to run in 1972 was not out of desperation, but of necessity. He will prove himself as the ruthless political operator that he is, while maintaining his dignity while doing so.",

I spent many, many weeks trying to learn how to develop a mod, and this was the main outcome of that effort. I've always really been interested in Alternate History and this mod was one of the ways I could express that interest. <p> My writing isn't the best, but I hope you were engaged with the gameplay of this mod. My coding skills are basically non-existent and I had to rely on gutting various mods for their codes. The Eighth Crisis was the mod that really got me into TCT and helped me discover one of my favorite artists, Penelope Scott, who is the creator of the soundtrack which I made using their mod's music code. I used Jet's mod tool to develop the backbone of the mod, and I also referenced mods like TTNW and All The Way for my writing, so I give massive thanks to the creators of those mods I robbed. </p><p> Thank you for taking the time out of your day to play my mod. I hope you had fun, and I hope you'll come back once in a while. Have a great day!"

He followed the strict path laid before him by his family. He was never supposed to be in this position. It wouldn't matter if it were John, or even Joe having a successful 8 years in the Oval Office. He simply wouldn't have mattered. but due to unfortunate circumstances, Robert Kennedy's name stands in the ballot box for the second time in 3 years. <p>\n\nKennedy did not plan to run this year. As Senator of New York, he was more than happy to bide his time and allow for the mythos around him to expand. But it seems that duty has called him. As the carcass of the New Deal coalition continues to rot, Kennedy must remind the American people of the past, and win the Presidency.",

That is the exact reason why Bobby chose him. Vance Hartke is not a man molded to be in the spotlight. He's a placeholder, a man who'll follow orders no questions asked. <p>His extensive pro-peace record appeals to the McGovernites, His history chairing the VA and serving in the military himself allows for Bobby to parade him as a man of the people.
