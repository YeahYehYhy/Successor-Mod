He alone must unite his fractious and bickering party. He alone must mobilize both his loyal following and the Party Establishment. He alone must open the eyes of the American people to the intolerable sight of poverty, discrimination, and war. <p>\n\nAbove all else, he must prove himself. He cannot allow himself to become a wasted opportunity, a footnote in the American story. He has to show he isn't a goddamn nepotist hire with a shiny name. He must show his ruthlessness, his political acumen, his charisma. After all, why would he be doing all this with nothing to show for it?\n",

I spent many, many weeks trying to learn how to develop a mod, and this was the main outcome of that effort. I hope you had fun trying to win as RFK in 1972. I chose to create this mod because i've been fascinated by political history in the 60s-70s era. I've always really been interested in Alternate History and this mod was one of the ways I could express that interest. <p> My writing isn't the best, but I hope you were engaged with the gameplay of this mod. My coding skills are basically non-existent and I had to rely on gutting various mods for their codes, so a massive thank you goes out to the creators of the mods I robbed. The Eighth Crisis was the mod that really got me into TCT and helped me discover one of my favorite artists, Penelope Scott, which is the soundtrack of this mod. I also took their music code. I used Jet's mod tool to develop the backbone of the mod. I also referenced mods like TTNW and All The Way for my writing, so I have to give massive thanks to the creators of those mods and tools. </p><p> Thank you for taking the time out of your day to play my mod. I hope you had fun, and I hope you'll come back once in a while. Have a great day!"

He followed the strict path laid before him by his family. He was never supposed to be in this position. It wouldn't matter if it were John, or even Joe having a successful 8 years in the Oval Office. He simply wouldn't have mattered. but due to unfortunate circumstances, Robert Kennedy's name stands in the ballot box for the second time in 3 years. <p>\n\nKennedy did not plan to run this year. As Senator of New York, he was more than happy to bide his time and allow for the mythos around him to expand. But it seems that duty has called him. As the carcass of the New Deal coalition continues to rot, Kennedy must remind the American people of the past, and win the Presidency.",

That is the exact reason why Bobby chose him. Vance Hartke is not a man molded to be in the spotlight. He's a placeholder, a man who'll follow orders no questions asked. <p>His extensive pro-peace record appeals to the McGovernites, His history chairing the VA and serving in the military himself allows for Bobby to parade him as a man of the people.
